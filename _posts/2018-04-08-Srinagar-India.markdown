The summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir. This city is about 50 kilometres from Gulmarg and is a must-visit if you are planning a trip to northern India. This city lies on the banks of river Jhelum. Srinagar captivates you with its natural beauty. Beautiful flower gardens are the main highlight of the city. These gardens have been around since the Mughal era.

The Dal Lake in the centre of the city is the most famous attraction. The lake has beautiful hills on one side and is covered with water lilies and lotus flowers in areas close to the banks. The shikara rides are incredible. They have floating shops! You could be on a shikara, taking a round of a lake and another shikara will pull up next to yours, offering you some fresh corn on the cob, or fruit salad, or in some cases shawls and other clothing items. On the sides of the lake there are boat houses, which are an excellent option to stay in, given that your hotel offers that facility.

Talking of shopping, there are many small shops along the lake. If you are looking for good cashmere or pashmina shawls or beautiful hand-woven carpets, this is the place to go. If you ask, the shop-keepers will also teach you the local way to drape the shawl or fold the carpet. Be sure to bargain a good price! You could also go to smaller shops along the banks of the lake and purchase various souvenirs. Kashmir is known for its delicately hand-painted paper mache objects. The skills involved in making these small objects will hold you spellbound!

I have visited Srinagar twice, once during winters and once during summers. During winters, the lake gets very cold, thus making it very difficult to go on the shikara. I personally recommend visiting this city during the summer. If you are someone who likes wildlife, go check out Dachigam National Park. They have a wonderful nature walk and if you’re lucky, you may see some wild animals on the move. Be sure to keep an eye out for unique birds. They also have a special area where they keep leopards and bears.

If you are someone who loves food, you are going to be in heaven. You must try the gucchi pulav. Gucchi is a very rare mushroom that is found in the Himalayas. Trust me, once you get a taste of this, there is no going back. It is quite expensive due to the fact that it is rare, however, it is so worth it! The Kashmiri kehwah is another must have. (I’ve mentioned this in my ‘Gulmarg’ blog as well, go check it out!)
