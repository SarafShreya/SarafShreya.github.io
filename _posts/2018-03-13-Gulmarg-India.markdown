Kashmir. Heaven on Earth. This place truly deserves this title. 
I went to a small town in Kashmir called Gulmarg. It is supposed to be the ski capital of India. To be honest, I was not disappointed. I went there twice, once in the month of December- for skiing, of course, and once in early June- for trekking. Both these times were so drastically different! 

In December, the whole valley was covered in snow. Every time I glanced outside the window, I could see beautiful snowflakes falling from the endless sky. When we would walk down the snow-covered roads, we would often see all shapes and sizes of snowmen staring at us from their backyards. Every morning people would gear up to get to the slopes to ski or snowboard or to just play around in the fresh, soft snow.

In Gulmarg there is a main ski slope which almost all tourists visit. To get up to this slope one has to take the gondola (you can walk it up too, if you’re feeling adventurous). The gondola stops at two phases: Phase 1 is the most popular phase as it is not as windy as the higher point and many first-time skiers prefer starting off from here. This phase has small food stalls which serve hot instant food. You can also rent a snow mobile and ride around for a while. The next phase is Phase 2. This is the point where not many people visit. It is incredibly windy at all times of the year and it is just a few kilometres away from the India-Pakistan border. If you are up for it, you can climb up to the highest point in Gulmarg- the Apharwat Peak (situated at a height of 4,390 metres above sea level) from this phase. Experienced skiers come up till this point to start their journey to the base of the mountain. 
Besides skiing, there is also an ice skating rink in the middle of the valley. You can roam around the valley on snow mobiles or sledges, or just choose to walk around.

During the summer season, the whole valley looks insanely different. Sledges are replaced by horse, snowmobiles are replaced with cycles. Covered in a carpet of lush green grass and fresh flowers blooming from every bush, it gives you the feeling of being in heaven. The golf course which would otherwise be hidden due to the snow comes to life as golfers gear up to take a chance at the game. The small hills which were covered with snow give birth to short fresh-water streams. These conditions make it the perfect place for a hike. Overall, Gulmarg is a very safe valley but it is advisable that you speak to a local resident before deciding to take off for a walk by yourself. 

Gulmarg is an excellent destination to visit at any time of the year. It is a place that someone of any age group can visit, however, the cold winters make it slightly difficult for senior citizens and young kids. Most hotels have a heated pool which you can use during the winters to just relax in. you must definitely try the Kashmiri drink called “kehwah” which is basically water boiled with spices. This small town is a place you must visit at least once in your life.
