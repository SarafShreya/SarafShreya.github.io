Masai Mara is paradise for all nature lovers. Surrounded by wildlife, this place is the place to go to if you need a break from the hustle-bustle of city life. Out here, you see nature in its purest form. Depending on where you stay, your mornings might start with the roar of a lion, or you might be greeted by a stork who is quietly trying to steal the bread off your plate while you’re eating breakfast!

This place makes you realise how vast the landscape is. You might be on your safari jeep, in the middle of the jungle, while your driver desperately tries to trace the leopard you have been following just for you to get a good picture. Or, you might be greeted by tall giraffes as they peek over the bushes to see you. When you see zebras, just like me, you may wonder if they are black with white stripes or white with black stripes… You may also come across warthogs (my favourite creatures) as they quizzically stare at you as if you are some species from Mars. 

If you do plan a visit to Masai Mara, try staying in a hotel close to some watering hole. This way, you could be chilling outside your room, sipping a nice drink while animals will come to the hole one by one, to drink water.

Fun fact, Warthogs are said to have a five-minute memory span. This means that at some point in time, they might be running from a carnivore, but midway they might just stop because they forgot why they were running!

For now, I shall leave you with this and let the pictures I clicked do the talking...
