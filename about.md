For me, travelling is all about new experiences. It is about realising that the world we live in does not limit itself to us and our immediate surroundings. It is a chance to be someone who never expected yourself to be. Travelling is getting out of your comfort zone. 

I developed the urge to visit new places at a very young age. I would get extremely excited when any of my family members would go for a vacation because that meant new things to play with! This excitement has developed itself over the years and now I make it a point to buy at least one souvenir from every city I visit. I know, it is the most “tourist” thing ever, but that for me is just like someone’s coin collection. It’s not really necessary but still, it’s something very personal. 

Well, through this blog I wish to spread my love for travel and I hope to encourage other people to explore the world. This universe is so much more than what we see or read about. 


(All comments and suggestions are incredibly valuable, so I would encourage you to pour out your feelings in the comment section under each post.)
